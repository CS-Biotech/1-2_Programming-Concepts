    "What is a dictionary?\n",
    "A <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**Dictionary**</span> in Python is an unordered collection of data in a key-value pair form, so each entry in this data structure is accompanied by a name. Imagine it like a real dictionary, where the description of a word would be a <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**'key'**</span>, and the name of the word itself is the <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**'value'**</span>. This analogy is commonly used as to access values in the dictionary data structure, you specify the key, like looking up a word in a real physical dictionary. Note to instatiate a dictionary, please use curly brackets {}. Here's a closer look:"

    "Another common way dictionaries are used is to map certain values to other values. For example, there are two distinct nomenclatures for identifying genes. In the examples below, the data you will be given will contain Ensembl IDs. As you may know, this way of identifying genes is very structured and ordered; however, it is very noninutuitve for a human reader. Thus, it would be beneficial for us to translate these IDs to Gene Symbols. There is a dictionary in a module called 'sanbomics' that helps us correlate which Ensembl ID maps to which Gene Symbol.
