    "Here we are going to look at a <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**Dictionary**</span> which is imported into our code from a CSV file. You don't have to memorize the function below, but take some time to familiarize yourself with how it operates. The function relies on Python's 'csv' package/module, which allows for inputting the data to utilize, as well as outputting data ('writing') to a CSV file. Essentially, our dictionary will contain the header of each column in the CSV file as the <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**'key'**</span> to the dictionary, and the actual data will be a list stored as the <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**'value'**</span>. In this fashion, the dataset can be stored in a simple structure for us to perform transformations or analysis on.\n",

    "Returning to our function to bring in comma-separated files, here's a quick breakdown of the provided code if you are interested:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CSV package is brought in or imported, so that we may use its functions and other premade code.\n",
    "- The csv_to_dict function is defined to facilitate the transformation of a CSV file into a dictionary.\n",
    "- It accepts a single parameter: the path to the CSV file.\n",
    "- Initially, an empty dictionary, data_dict, is established to harbor the data.\n",
    "- Upon opening the CSV file in reading mode, a DictReader object is instantiated. This special object lets us interpret each row of the file as a dictionary.\n",
    "- The dictionary is then prepared by populating it with empty lists corresponding to each header in the CSV. This sets up our storage schema for the dataset.\n",
    "- As the function processes each row of the CSV file, it associates every data value with its corresponding header in the dictionary.\n",
    "- Lastly, the function is exemplified with a file named 'hf_data_raw.csv', demonstrating how it processes and prints the resulting dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using this dataset for the next few questions."
