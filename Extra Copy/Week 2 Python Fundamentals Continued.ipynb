    "In the premodule exercises, you touched on a new variable/data structure, dictionaries. Dictionaries offer an efficient method for organizing and retrieving data using unique keys. It's essential to note that they are akin to, but distinct from, lists. While lists store values indexed by their positions, dictionaries link values to a unique key, facilitating easy modification and retrieval. They can represent various data types, ranging from extensive text-based datasets like clinical information to mapping specific labels to particular values. In essence, dictionaries are a versatile and prevalent data structure in data science endeavors."

    "A <span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**Python module**</span> is essentially a file containing Python code, custom made for very specific purposes, that can include functions, variables and various other snippets of necessary code. Modules, such as **pandas**, are designed to be reusable, allowing programmers to organize and share code efficiently across different projects. By importing a module, users can access its functions and code within their own files, facilitating modularity of code and further reducing redundancy. Think of it as a sticker pack for a messaging platform, or tools in a toolbox. They don't come with Python itself for if we included all of our niche functionalities right of the get go, that would be quite the heavy toolbox where most of the tools would not be used. Instead, we may import our tools into our toolbox to fit our needs in preparation for a task we know we will need to complete.\n",

It is is a control structure that's used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Imagine having to print numbers from 1 to 1000 without a loop. That is a lot of typing (or copy and pasting). With loops, such tasks become trivial. \n",

By the end of this section of the module, we would like to be able to calculate the average of a column/varable within our heart failure dataset itself. This means that we would like to take the sum of the values in a column, platlet levels, for example, and then divide this sum by the number of values in the column intself. By summing the entries, this require us to iterate through the column; hence, we can leverage the characteristic of a for loop to help us acheive this calculation.\n",

    "Once our CSV file is opened in Excel, you can treat it like any other spreadsheet. You may edit cells, add rows/columns, apply formulas, etc. However, remember that a csv file is a much simpler file type than xlsx, so sometimes Excel may have trouble formatting its data, and as well changes done in the dataset through Excel may not be properly saved in the csv format. After editing, you can save it as a CSV again by selecting File > Save As and choosing the CSV format and just keep the name as is if you would like to overwrite the previous version.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a CSV in Excel and see all the data in the first column, it might be because the CSV uses a different delimiter (like a semicolon or a tab). You can use Excel's \"Text to Columns\" feature in the Data tab to correctly separate the values. Usually, there will be a window that asks you about the formatting of the file when you first open it, make sure you check to see that Excel has the correct values in each cell. Lucky for us, this is not an issue with `hf_data_raw.csv`."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this week's module imparted knowledge on dictionaries, for loops, functions, and the crucial aspect of working with CSV files. By assimilating these concepts, we establish a foundational understanding of data manipulation and processing in Python. To summarize:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**Dictionaries**</span>: These are unordered collections in Python used to store data in key-value pairs. They offer rapid data access based on unique keys. This feature distinguishes them from lists, which are ordered and utilize index-based access. Dictionaries employ curly braces '{}' for creation. Data is accessed via their corresponding keys, and one can easily add or modify key-value pairs using assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**For Loop**</span>: A control structure in Python, the for loop iterates over sequences (like lists, tuples, or strings) or other iterable objects. This enables executing a specific code block multiple times, once per sequence item. The 'range' function, often used with for loops, generates a number sequence and helps keep track of iteration counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**Functions**</span>: These are segments of reusable code tailored to execute specific tasks. They can accept parameters and return results. Defined using the 'def' keyword, functions are invoked by their name, accompanied by parentheses. Parameters act as placeholders for values that a function accepts. The real values supplied to these placeholders are termed arguments. To send back results to the function caller, the 'return' keyword is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"background-color: #AFEEEE\">**CSV File Format**</span>: The CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file format is crucial in data handling tasks. It's a simple, plain-text format that represents tabular data, making it universally readable by various software and programming languages. Within a CSV file, data is structured in rows, often with the first row serving as headers. These headers act as identifiers for the data columns, facilitating organized data processing and manipulation. Understanding the structure and characteristics of the CSV format is foundational to effective data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering these concepts, one steps closer to becoming proficient in data-driven tasks using Python, paving the way for more advanced topics in the future."
